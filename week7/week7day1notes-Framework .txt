    ->LeafBot FrameWork which is a hybrid framework
    ->This framework is desiged based on POM design pattern
    ->We use Selenium WebDriver to interact with web Applications
	->TestNG for data Execution
	->Apache POI to read data from excel to process mutiple data testing
	->Cucumber to support BDD approach
	->Extent reports is used to generate html automation summary report
	->We use both TestNG and Cucumber in this Hybrid_Framework
	
Components :
============
   ->We use Browser and Element as Interfaces to have design pattern related to browser and element activities
     like open browser	and findElement respectively
   ->SeleniumBase is the libraray to have all the wrapper methods or unimplemented methods  
   ->ProjectSpecificMethods to have all the common methods specific to the project
   ->pages to have all the classes related to each pages 
   ->testcases to have all the classes for each testcases
   ->utils package to have all the classes related to external applications
        DataLibrary->to read data from Excel
		Reporter->to generate all the reports
