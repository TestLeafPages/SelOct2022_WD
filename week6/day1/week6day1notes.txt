Cucumber:
=========
   ->BDD Automation tool
   
TDD:
====
   Test Driven Development
   -Write the testcases first
   -REview and approve the testcases by the project team
   -Approved testcases will drive the development   

ATDD:
=====
   Acceptance Test Driven Development
   -Write User Acceptance testcases first
   -REview and approve the testcases by the project team
   -Approved testcases will drive the development   

BDD:
====
  Behavior Driven Development
  To solve the communication gap between the non-technical team and the tech-team (Dev&Testers)using Gherkin language
  -Test Scenarios are captured first as behaviours using the common language which is understandable by tech and non tech team
  -Approved testcases will drive the development
  ->Software development approach
Gherkin keywords:
================
  Feature: Used to describe the functionality
  Scenario: Used to describe the testcases
  Given: Used to represent pre-condition
  When: Used to represent the test condition/step
  Then: Used to represent the expected result for positive scenario
  But: Used to represent the expected result for negative scenario
  
  Background: Common pre conditions
  Scenario Outline $ Examples: To pass Multiple data
  And: Used as a conjunction when we have BDD keywords repeating consequetively
  
Steps to start with Cucumber:
===========================
   -Check the dependencies  in pom.xml
   -Check for the plugin installed
   -In src/test/java create three packages
       -features
	      Right Click package->New->File->Login.feature->Finish
	   -steps
	   -runner
	   
Steps to create a Feature file:
==============================
  1)Type Feature: and type the description
  2)Type Scenario: And mention the testcase using Gherkin keywords
  3)Create a class under steps package 
  4)Create methods for each of the gherkin keywords mentioned in the feature file under Scenario  
  5)Create Runner class in the runner package 
      -extend runner class with AbstractTestNGCucumberTests
	  -On the top of the class Use @CucumberOptions and use the attributes
	    -features("path of feature file")
		-glue=steps package name
		-monochrome->to remove the junk files in the console
		-publish-To display the cucumber report in the console
How to parameterize the data?
=============================
    1)Find the data that is to be parameterized for a testcase
    2)Enclose the data with '' single quote in the feature file
	3)In stepDefinition replace the data with {string}
	4)Pass the arguments and replace the hardcoded data with argument
