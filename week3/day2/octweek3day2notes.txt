Todays Agenda:
==============
  1)9:30-11:00->Abstraction
  2)11:00-11:30->Classroom
  3)11:30-12:30->Waits
  
Abstraction:
============
    Display only the relevant information to the end-user and hide irrelevant features

     -Interface
     -Abstract Class
     -Concrete Class
	 
Interface:
==========
    
       - Design Document/BluePrint
	   - Keyword implements 
	   - 100% Abstract
	   - Cannot instantiate the Interface(cannot create an object for an Interface)
	   
	   
Concrete vs Abstract vs Interface:
=================================
      -Not fully ready(it can have both implemented+Abstract)
      -abstract keyword is mandatory,if you write an abstract method
      -It is not mandatory to implement all the methods of Interface
      -we can have our own abstract method
	  -Cannot create an object for an abstract class
       
Classroom:
==========
     Create an interface for Mobile
	 Write 3 different methods (abstract)
	 Create a class-IPhone
	 Make sure all the 3 methods appear 
	 
	 
Waits:
======
    implicitlyWait-Selenium wait
	Thread.sleep()->Java wait
